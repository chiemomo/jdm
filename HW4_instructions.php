For HW4, you are required to do Part A OR Part B. For both parts, start with the user system website that is included in the homework files. Before you begin, change the names of all tables to include your netid so that no two homeworks try to create or modify the same table. Also, change the folder name to include your netid and modify the constants for the site base to match the name of the folder. Verify that you can create a user and log in. For the homework, activate each user by default (i.e., do not use email for activation). Good luck!

------------------------------------------------------------
PART A
------------------------------------------------------------

For Part A, your task is to add the option for a user to upload a photo. You shold add this option in the page that allows a user to update their profile. Upon successful upload, the user should be able to see their photo in their profile page. Finally, add an area to the page that is visible to everyone (regardless of whether the user is logged in) which lists all registered users along with their photos. 

EXTRA CREDIT:
[ 2 pts ] Allow the user to update an "About Me" section in their profile. You will have to add a correspnding field or table to store that information. Then, in the page that lists the users along with their photos, show the "About Me" text as well for each user. 
[ 3 pts ] Allow the user to upload multiple photos and then select which one they want shown in their profile page



------------------------------------------------------------
PART B
------------------------------------------------------------

For Part B, your task is to add an area to the page called "My Blog" which allows a logged in user to write a blog entry which will be stored in the database. Then, add a new area called "User Blogs" which lists all blog entries written by all users order by the data/timestamp at which those blog entries were created. The "User Blogs" area should be visible to anyone, while the "My Blog" area should be visible only to users that are logged in. 

EXTRA CREDIT:

[3 pts] Allow users to edit their own blog entries.
[2 pts] Allow users to upload 1 photo associated with their blog entry. The page that shows the blog entries should also show the photo associated with each entry.
